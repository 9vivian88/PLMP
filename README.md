# PLMP -- point-line minimal problems
This repository hosts code for checking minimality and computing algebraic degrees of relative pose estimation problems in computer vision involving complete correspondences of points, lines, and their incidence relations across some number of views. It was used to classify all [PLMPs in complete multi-view visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10008). 

To get started, read through and execture the Macaulay2-based examples appearing in [this supplemental document](./supplementary.pdf) (See caveats.)

## Caveats
   
* Certain computations may take a long time (couple of hours) and may exceed the RAM capacity (one example employing F4 consumed ~16Gb).  
* At the moment the numerical degree computations need a version of Macaulay2 at [this branch of this fork](https://github.com/timduff35/M2/tree/monodromy).
